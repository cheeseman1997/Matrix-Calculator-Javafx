# Matrix-Calculator-Javafx
A simple matrix operations calculator entirely written in java (version 15) and uses javafx

The tools allows you to do the following operations (the tool will check if the operation is doable):
1. Add two matrices
2. Subtract two matrices
3. Multiply matrix with a scalar
4. Matrix-matrix multiplication
5. Determinant calculation (only 2*2 and 3*3 matrix)
6. take matrix to the power of N
7. Transpose matrix
8. Inverse matrix
9. Eigenvalue calculation
10. Generate identity martix
11. Reduced Row Echelant form

todo:
1. finish Reduced Row Echelant form (only for 2*2 and potentially for 3*3 matrix)
2. finish Eigenvalue calculation (2*2 matrix only)
3. refactor code for more readability
4. add new functions
